## Dependency Management

Kinsta automatically installs dependencies defined in your `package.json` file during the deployment process.

## Web Server Setup

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application. The `serve` package utilizes the port set by Kinsta automatically.

### Start Command

When deploying an application, Kinsta automatically creates a web process with `npm start` as the entry point. Make sure to use this command to run your server.

## Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit) the `npm build` command is run, followed by the `npm start` command.

## What is Cuttlebelle
Cuttlebelle is a static site builder that breaks down each page into content blocks that you can later assemble to create various page layouts without the need to understand or use complex code. More information is available on the [Cuttlebelle](https://cuttlebelle.com/) website.
